UofM Challenge 5 - Build a daily schedule app

## Description
We were given a daily schedule layout and tasked with the requirement to make it a functional daily planner list
Blocks are available for each hour of the workday. The user can edit the text, and if they hit a save button it will save their
entry to local storage
The background color of the hour blocks changes based on tbhe current time. Red for the current hour, gray for past hours, and green
for future hours


The daily schedule is deployed at https://dbrainz.github.io/daily-schedule/
